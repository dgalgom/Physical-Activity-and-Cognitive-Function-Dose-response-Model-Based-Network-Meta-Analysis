#Two features are particularly important for Model-Based Network Meta-Analysis (MBNMA): network connectivity and dose-response relationship.
#We have to check if our dataset has the right format.


#EXAMINING NETWORK CONNECTIVITY

network <- mbnma.network(data)

##Treatment-level (specific doses of a specific agent)

plot(network, v.color = "agent", label.distance = 4, remove.loops = TRUE)

##Agent-level

plot(network, level = "agent", label.distance = 3)

##Connectivity checking and information about the network

summary(network)


#EXAMINING THE DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP

#To consider what functional and appropriate forms can be applied to model the dose-response relationship, it is useful to look at the results
#of a "split" network meta-analysis (NMA).

nma_network <- MBNMAdose::mbnma.run(network, method = "random")
print(nma_network)

##We can examine the consistency of out split model comparing with an unrelated mean effects (UME) model.

ume_network <- MBNMAdose::mbnma.run(netowrk, method = "random", UME = TRUE)
print(ume_network) #if no signiificant differences: good fit.

theme_minimal() #It seems that dose-response relationship follows a positive trend: the higher the dose, the greater effects on cognitive function.
#However, the relationship does not seem linear.


#DOSE-RESPONSE MBNMA

#First, we must be clear about how to modeling the dose-response relationship: what functions we are going to use and what parameters we are going to estimate.

#Emax function

emax <- mbnma.emax(network, emax = "rel", ed50 = "rel", method = "random")
print(emax)

#Restricted cubic spline and knots

knots <- c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9)
rcs <- mbnma.run(network, fun = "rcs", knots = knots, method = "random")
print(rcs)

#Non-parametric dose-response function

non_param <- mbnma.run(network, fun = "nonparam.up", method = "random")
print(non_param)

#After comparing the adjusted models, Emax function and Restricted cubic spline (rcs) function presented best fits. Emax function allowed us to know what is the maximum response of each agent (Emax parameter),
#and at which dose the half of the maximum response is achieved (ED50 parameter). Finally, we used the rcs function to model post-estimations of the dose-response associations.

##To assess how well a model fits the data

###Deviance plots

devplot <- MBNMAdose::devplot(emax, plot.type = "boxplot")
devplot.1 <- MBNMAdose::devplot(rcs, plot.type = "boxplot")

###Fitted values

fits <- MBNMAdose::fitplot(emax)
fits.1 <- MBNMAdose::fitplot(rcs)

#Forest plots

plot(emax)
plot(rcs)
plot(non_param)

#PREDICTIONS

#After performing a MBNMA, responses can be predicted from the model parameters estimates. E0 is the response at dose = 0 (equivalent to Placebo response). The placebo response must be modeled
#by the user in some way (deterministic, stochastic, from a set of studies, ...). 

#Predicting a continuous dose-response relationship for each agent with a deterministic estimate E0 = 0 (i.e., assumption: placebo response = 0)
